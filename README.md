I currently work as Senior Data Scientist within TransUnion’s Consulting division, specifically within Financial Services. The role involves working with cross-functional teams on multitude of business problems. This coupled with my previous work experience and my master’s degree has enabled me to convert business problems into data requirements, perform necessary analysis and deliver the results to a non-technical audience. I believe my experience with time series models and Shiny dashboard have certainly provided me with the ideal skillset for this position. A recent Shiny dashboard that I built: https://demoapps.shinyapps.io/Transfer_Market_Analysis/.
